3). What is python?

Answer :-
          Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
          Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
          Here are some key features and aspects of Python:


Key Features of Python:

1. Simple and Readable Syntax:

* Python’s syntax is designed to be easy to read and write, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced developers alike.

2. Interpreted Language:

* Python code is executed line-by-line by an interpreter, which makes the debugging process easier and allows for interactive coding sessions.

3. Dynamically Typed:

* Python does not require explicit declaration of variable types. The type is determined at runtime, which adds flexibility but can sometimes lead to runtime errors if not handled carefully.

4. Versatile and General-Purpose:

* Python can be used for a wide range of applications, from web development and automation to data analysis and artificial intelligence.

5. Extensive Standard Library:

* Python’s standard library includes modules and packages that provide a wide range of functionalities, reducing the need to write code from scratch.

6. Large and Active Community:

* Python has a vast and active community, which contributes to a rich ecosystem of third-party libraries, frameworks, and tools.
  Community support also means extensive documentation and numerous learning resources.

7. Cross-Platform:

* Python is cross-platform, meaning it can run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, without requiring changes to the code.
